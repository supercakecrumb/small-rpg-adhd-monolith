## UI polish backlog

- Rarity/HUD improvements: refine header HUD visuals, tune rarity tag palette/gradients, and adjust glow balance once core cheese/quest UX stabilizes.
- Avatar polish: finalize deterministic emoji assignment + subtle owner glow; ensure only top bar and party list use avatars.
- Rarity tags: finish rarity/quantity dynamic coloring pass and HUD cheese animation refinements.
- Section hues: subtle per-section tint/gloom tuning (quests green-teal, market amber, party blue-grey) with cohesive glow levels.
- Micro-animations: gentle hover/feedback refinements (quests finish, market buy) once core layout is stable.
